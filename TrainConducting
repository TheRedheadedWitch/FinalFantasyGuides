# Train Conducting

Train Conducting was very intimidating for me at first. I was worried I screw things up and piss people off. But, it actually isn't as hard as it looks. In fact, most of the work for train conductors goes into preparing links and planning the route in advance. Well ... *SCREW ALL THAT* because I don't like having to do the same shit over and over each day that I could have a plugin or program do for me. So I wrote Train Conductor, so I could be lazy as hell each day while still giving people the speed they require.

If you don't have Train Conductor, go to the resources down below and get it.


## Resources

Train Conductor can be added from one of two repositories. I suggest adding the Mega Repository because it has *EVERYTHING* and if something is missing from there, either tell me or the person who runs the scripts and they will add it. It takes literally 1 minutes to add a repository and then within 5 minutes, it will be there (5 minutes for the script that makes the repo to cycle).

Main Repository => `https://github.com/TheRedheadedWitch/FFXIVRepository/blob/main/repo.json`
Mega Repository => `https://github.com/WilliamW1979/FFXIV/blob/main/repository.json`
