# Lifestream Custom Aliases

To use these, you just type `/lifestream` to bring up the main lifestream configuration window, click on the third tab called **Custom Alias** and click on the button at the very bottom on the left side that says **Try to Import an item from your clipboard**. It will be the second button.
