# Game Settings for Proper Scouting

If you want to scout fast, you need to increase the amount of monsters that show up on your map. To do this, follow these instructions.

> 1. Press CTRL + K to open up your <b>SYSTEM CONFIGURATION</b> window.
> 2. Click on <b>OTHER SETTINGS</b> which is the second from last button on the left that is 3 dots.
> 3. 4th option is Display Limits, increase the Character Display Range to Maximum

This will allow your game to show the monsters at a far greater distance, which you will see in your screen if you look carefully enough.
