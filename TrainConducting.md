# Train Conducting

Train Conducting was very intimidating for me at first. I was worried I screw things up and piss people off. But, it actually isn't as hard as it looks. In fact, most of the work for train conductors goes into preparing links and planning the route in advance. Well ... *SCREW ALL THAT* because I don't like having to do the same shit over and over each day that I could have a plugin or program do for me. So I wrote Train Conductor, so I could be lazy as hell each day while still giving people the speed they require.

If you don't have Train Conductor, go to the resources down below and get it.

### Preparing Train Conductor plugin
You will want to prepare Train Conductor so that it is readyto use. The main window, on the right side you will see an Edit box called Chat Message. This is where you type your own custom message that you will be sending out to everyone. The message you send out should be something that is custom to you (we shouldn't all use the same messages, would be obvious we are using plugins). You can use placeholders to add special things that will change. A list of placeholders can be found by clicking the ? at the top of the window in the title bar.

Once you have typed the message you like, read it in the Preview section. Remember to use <flag> because when you click Send, it will create a flag at the location of the monster at the top of the list. If you want to send that location out, you will need the <flag>. It will still say <flag> in your preview and this is perfect, because the game itself will parse it for you. You can test this out by unchecking all chat options except Echo, which will only be displayed in your chat for you to see. The server doesn't receive anything in this transaction.

Clicking the **Settings** button in the title bar will open your settings window. The top part is where you put in the information for your A Train. This will include the expansion, the starting Aetheryte, the instance if there is one, and the time you plan to start your train. These will need to be set up each time you host a train and there is no getting around it, but it is only 3 or 4 things to click (3 if you don't have instances and leave it at none for most of the time, 4 when we have to deal with instances).

The second part of settings is broken up into two sections. The left side is for your Discord message. This is custom tailored for Faloop but you can use it for any Discord. I recommend using <TimeDiscord> and <@> in yourmessage because this automatically puts in a Discord Time Stamp in Discord for you and the role for Faloop. As for everything else, it comes down to whatever you want to do. Custom make your own message, view it down below. Just note that the 2 placeholders I mentioned won't look right in the output but you will see a change that shows it is working. When you are ready, copy and paste it into the Discord Channel. For Dynamis, you would use [Dynamis A Train Channel](https://discord.com/channels/321601714035884034/1000265199548379238). You need permissions to see this channel.

The right side is for sending an announcement in game in the different chats. The In-Game Chat Preview will show you EXACTLY what is being sent, don't forget the <flag> because the Send Chat Announcement will first create a flag at the Aetheryte of where you are planning to start and then <flag> will show the map link to that location. You can test this out in Party chat, then once you are happy, click the ones you want this to be sent every time.

Once you have the messages set up, you never need to touch them again. Once typed, they are saved for you. You just have to change the 4 options at the top if you used the proper placeholders below.

## Pre-Starting your A Train
At this point, you have your messages set up the way you want. You have your scout report ready to go! This is how easy it is to run a train. Preparation for your train is simple, just follow these steps.

1. Click on **Export** from your scout report.
2. Click on **Import** in the main window of the plugin.
3. Select the Expansion you wish to run. (You will see the monster list).
4. Looking at your scout report's map, determine the order you want to attack each monster on each map. Use the up and down arrows to move the monsters up or down. Generally, you want to keep the zones in the same order and only flip the monsters to which one you want to attack first.
5. Click on settings in the title bar.
6. Select your Expansion, the Start Location, None (or instance if there is one), and the time in military time.
7. Click the Discord Copy Button
8. Paste into Faloop's Channel for your A Train
9. While in Faloop, go to the scout report and click START TRAIN
10. Click on Send Chat Announcement so everyone knows when and where you are starting.
11. Close out your Settings Window
12. Verify the chats you want your messages to go out to and make sure they are checked.
13. You are done, you are waiting until start time.

These 13 steps take under a minute to do, they are very simple and basic. Most of them you were already doing anyways with a lot of added effort and headache. You are now ready to run your train.
[!Note]
If you are running multiple trains back to back, I suggest going back into your settings and setting up your next train now while you wait for the start time. This way, you can even send the messages while you are still on the last zone if you wish.

## Running the A Train
Now the time has come to run your train. Here is how you run your train.

1. Warn people you are about to start, I generally send a shout.
2. Click the Send button
3. Fly to your target
4. Kill your target
5. Watch the target automatically be removed from your list
6. Repeat steps 2 through 5 until your list is empty
7. You are Done!

Yes, basically you are doing nothing special except clicking send every time you kill an A Rank. Most of those steps are literally just doing the hunt!

## Resources

Train Conductor can be added from one of two repositories. I suggest adding the Mega Repository because it has *EVERYTHING* and if something is missing from there, either tell me or the person who runs the scripts and they will add it. It takes literally 1 minutes to add a repository and then within 5 minutes, it will be there (5 minutes for the script that makes the repo to cycle).

Main Repository => `https://github.com/TheRedheadedWitch/FFXIVRepository/blob/main/repo.json`<br>
Mega Repository => `https://github.com/WilliamW1979/FFXIV/blob/main/repository.json`<br>
