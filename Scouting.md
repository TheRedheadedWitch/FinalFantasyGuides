# Scouting

Scouting for A Trains can be easy, or can be hard. It comes down to you. If you prefer the **Easy** way then you are in the right place!

1. First thing you need to do is adjust your in game settings. Here is a quick guide on how to do so. [Scouting Guide](https://github.com/TheRedheadedWitch/FinalFantasyGuides/blob/main/ScoutGameSettings.md)
2. You need three plugins, here is a guide on setting them up [Scouting Plugins]

Once you have done those two steps, you are all set up and ready to go. Here are the steps you will need to take to scout.

1. Type `/scouth` as this will open up your Scout Helper.
2. Click on the buttoncalled **COLLAB** at the bottom right corner. This will open a popup window.
3. Click **START NEW SESSION** in the middle of this popup.
4. In your chatbox, a link will appear. Click it and open it up inyour browser.

Now your Scout Helper is all set up. Just a few easy clicks. The link on your browser is so you don't lose it, you will need it later to post your scout report into Faloop. You can watch it update in real time if you like.

5. Type the command for the scouting you wish to do (If you are using mine, type `/li a100` for Dawntrail).

At this point, your character will teleport and start moving around the zones. If you are using mine, I created them not to fly to each hunt point directly, but rather just to come into range to see each one. This cuts the time down to scout by A LOT so that you can be done fast. Dawntrail will be done in under 6 minutes. I am still working on making them even more efficient and if you can create your own alias that is faster, please let me know and submit it!

6. Go get a drink, watch a YouTube video, etc ... while you wait for the Lifestream command to complete.
7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 until you scout every patch you want to scout.
8. Submit your report to Faloop via the proper channel for your data center. For Dynamis, you would use [Faloop's Dynamis Scout Link](https://discord.com/channels/321601714035884034/1129918501461688370) if you have the proper permissions to see and access it. You type /scout and then add the server, patch, and your turtle share code. Make sure you are not sharing your EDIT code, else someone could go in and erase all your hard work.
9. You are done!
